# SimplePipelineCore


## 1. Goal

### Aim: 

* creating a power efficicent processor for future projects, which is going to be sensor signal processing, NPU, and communicating other devices via BLE.

### Objectives: 

* following RISC-V 32 integer Instruction Set Architecture.
* implementing out-of-order pipeline microarchitecture.
* receiving and processing data directly without load/store data to a memory/reg.
* optimizing the microarchitecture for looping and receiving data.

### Methods:

* Simulating the design with SystemVerilog ( with UVM - need to learn UVM at this moment Nov 9,2023)
* Emulating the RTL  on PYNQ-Z2 or Genesys 2

## 2. Architecture


### Microarchitecture version 0.1.2~0.1.4

* implemented more details and created connections for load,store, jump and branch operations.
  * RV32I ISA checker: checks the instruction is for Risc-V 32 bit integer ISA; inst[4:0]=bbb11 (bbb != 111).
  * Queue: holds and distributes operations to execution units from the decoder
  * Register checker (proposal for 0.2.0): Checks the current operation using previous registers on the other stages. Later, this can be used for out-of-order. Placed between the decoder and the scheduler)

### Microarchitecture version 0.1(MicroArch 0.1)

The goal of version 0.1 is to implement pipeline. Arch 0.1 is not targeting to implement out-of-order, thus it is in-order.

## 3. Implementation: MicroArch 0.1.4

* in-order pipeline            x
* RV32I ISA                    x
* direct port signal access    x
* looping optimization         x

## 4. Learned & Improved

* Starting with small design modules; gradual expansion.
