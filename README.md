# SimplePipelineCore


## 1. goal
The goal of this project is to understand and develop a modern RISC architecture with out-of-order instruction pipeline. This CPU will support Risc V 32 bit integer Instruction Set version 2.0. 

Instruction pipeline means each CPU stage(Fetch, Decode, Execution, and Write-back) works on a instruction in order, instead waiting for the previous stage finishes the instruction.

## 2. Architecture


### Microarchitecture version 0.1.2(Arch 0.1.2)

* implemented more details and created connections for load,store, jump and branch operations.
 * RV32I ISA checker: checks the instruction is for Risc-V 32 bit integer ISA; inst[4:0]=bbb11 (bbb != 111).
 * Queue: holds and distributes operations to execution units from the decoder
 * Register checker (proposal for 0.2.0): Checks the current operation using previous registers on the other stages. Later, this can be used for out-of-order. Placed between the decoder and the scheduler)



### Microarchitecture version 0.1(MicroArch 0.1) 

![image](https://github.com/Enanter/SimplePipelineCore/blob/main/Architecture_Diagram/Oct_3_2023_FDEWDiagram.png)
The goal of version 0.1 is implementing pipeline. Arch 0.1 is not targeting to implement out-of-order, thus it is in-order.

## 4. Stages

[Front-end] Fetch and Decode. (Check instructions)

[Back-end] Execution and Write-back. (Control data)

 ### 1.  Fetch 
 Find the instruction on the current program counter. Control program counter.
  * L1i:
  * Program Counter: Tells the current instruction line number.
    * Stage Checker: check each stage is done. essencial for pipelining.
      
 ### 2.  Decode
 Decode the instruction and send signals to back-end to do operations.
  * L1d read:
  * Register Files:
    
 ### 3.  Execution
 Execute operations.

 ### 4.  Write-back
 Save the data to the Level 1 data cache.
  * L1d write:
  * Register Files:
